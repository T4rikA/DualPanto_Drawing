# DualPanto_Drawing

This is a drawing application for the DualPanto.
Tick "mouse" in the lineDraw component of the Panto Object to be able to easily draw with your mouse. Having a DualPanto at hand please make sure, that "mouse" isn't selected.

You will start at Level 1 to learn how to use the drawing App.
Go to Level 6 to have just a short introduction and immediatly start drawing. You can do that by writing a 6 in the Main Scene in the GameManager component.

**Disable the levelMode to be able to freely draw in case that you already know how to use the app.**


Have fun drawing.
